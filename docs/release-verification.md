# Release verification

`tutorials/zoedepth_metric_depth_colab.ipynb` (`TASK-INFERENCE`, **standalone** carrier) is a
**release candidate** until the exact notebook revision has executed top-to-bottom in a clean
supported runtime. Unit tests, JSON validation, code-cell compilation, the generator parity checks
and `tools/validate_release_assets.py` are necessary checks but are **not** runtime evidence under
DIMER Notebook Specification 2.0. This file is the durable release-gate record for the notebook.

## Automatic coverage (static, every pull request)

CI runs `tools/validate_release_assets.py`, which checks:

- notebook JSON parses; every code cell compiles as plain Python (no `%`/`!` magics); no
  persisted outputs or execution counts; no unresolved placeholder markers; every code cell
  is preceded by an explanatory markdown cell;
- exactly one tutorial notebook, named in `tutorials/README.md` with its `TASK-INFERENCE`
  profile, the notebook-spec version and the standalone carrier; `metadata.dimer` declares that
  profile, spec `2.0`, a pedagogical mode, `standalone: true` and `generated_from` (repository, revision, module
  SHA-256, generator);
- the standalone carrier (ST1–ST6, PAR1–PAR3): no clone, repository install or repository import on
  the primary path; exactly one cell tagged `embedded_module` equal to
  `src/zoedepth_metric_depth_pipeline/pipeline.py` after the generator's documented rewrites; the
  inline `MANIFEST` equal to the committed snapshot manifest and the inline `PINS` equal to the
  `pyproject.toml` runtime pins; the notebook byte-identical (on LF) to `tools/build_notebook.py`
  output for its recorded revision; the pinned-install cell with its restart-on-stale-import guard;
  `NOTEBOOK_SOURCE` recorded in exports;
- `MODEL_ID`/`MODEL_REVISION` are bound only in the carried module cell (and repeated in the inline
  manifest, which the notebook asserts against the module before fetching), the revision is a 40-hex
  immutable commit, and the same identity string appears in `README.md`, `MODEL_CARD.md`, and
  `docs/WEIGHTS.md` with no stray revisions;
- the profile-specific public-API calls (`stage_missing_files`, `verify_snapshot`,
  `ZoeDepthMetricPipeline.from_pretrained(weights_dir=...)`, `validate_inputs`, `predict`,
  `evaluation_report`), the ceiling print (`MIN_IMAGE_SIDE`, `MAX_IMAGE_SIDE`, `MAX_ASPECT_RATIO`,
  `DEPTH_KIND`, `DEPTH_UNIT`, `DEPTH_RANGES_M`, `FLIP_AUGMENTATION`, `DELTA_THRESHOLD`), the exports, the
  learner-facing statements (caller-owned flip flag, metres are an estimate not a measurement, metric depth
  needs a reference in metres, `not-measurable` by design, a smooth depth map is not a correct one,
  capability exclusions) and the gated-off BYOD default listed in the validator; forbidden patterns
  (credential-in-URL, any `git clone` / `github.com` / repository import on the primary path, a mutable
  `revision='main'`, direct `from transformers import` / `ZoeDepthForDepthEstimation` /
  `ZoeDepthImageProcessor` / `post_process_depth_estimation(` / `from huggingface_hub import` use
  **outside the carried module cell**, `trust_remote_code=True`, `pickle.load`, `torch.load(`,
  `extractall(`);
- `STATUS.md`, `README.md` and `tutorials/README.md` agree on one release-status token and no
  document makes an unsupported release-grade, production-readiness or benchmark claim;
- `MODEL_CARD.md` front matter (`model_card_spec: "1.1"`), single H1, required heading order, and
  immutable provenance.

CI also installs the pinned CPU-only torch wheel plus `transformers`, `safetensors`, `numpy` and
`pillow`, runs `ruff check src tests tools`, `tools/build_notebook.py --check`, and the offline unit
suite (`tests/test_pipeline.py`, `tests/test_role_helpers.py`, `tests/test_notebook_parity.py`;
injected runner, no weights). These are source/provenance and unit checks. They are **not** execution
evidence.

## Executor paths

| Path | Runtime | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Google Colab (supported user path) | Colab CPU runtime (CUDA used automatically when present) | The runtime the tutorial is written for; a clean top-to-bottom run here is promotion evidence |
| Kaggle CLI kernel | Kaggle CPU kernel, Python 3.12 image | Reproducible clean-room executor of the same class; the notebook is pushed verbatim plus one leading shim cell that provides `google.colab` and chdirs to a scratch directory (**no repository checkout is needed — the notebook is standalone**) |
| Local Windows-venv harness (pre-flight only) | Workstation, sequential cell executor with a `google.colab` shim, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1` | Builder pre-flight to catch defects before spending cloud runs; **not** a supported runtime and not promotion evidence |

## Supported release verification procedure

Before changing the registry status from `Candidate` to `Release-grade`:

1. resolve the exact PR/commit head under review and confirm static CI is green;
2. open that exact notebook revision in a new CPU (or CUDA) runtime (Colab, or the Kaggle
   executor above) with **no repository checkout** and a clean model cache;
3. run the notebook top-to-bottom without editing implementation cells (form parameters at their
   defaults for the sample path: `USE_BYOD = False`, `flip_augmentation = False`);
4. verify that Section 1 reports `NOTEBOOK_SOURCE.repository_revision` equal to the revision recorded
   in `metadata.dimer.generated_from` and that the installed core package versions equal the inline
   `PINS` (= `pyproject.toml`);
5. verify every default-path stage completes:
   - pinned runtime installed from the inline `PINS` with no GitHub access;
   - the carried module cell executes (defines `ZoeDepthMetricPipeline`, `validate_inputs`,
     `evaluation_report`, `abs_rel`, `delta1`, `verify_snapshot`, `stage_missing_files`) with no import
     of the repository package;
   - synthetic 640×480 cartoon room drawn in code with its RGB SHA-256 printed and the ceilings
     (`MIN_IMAGE_SIDE` 32, `MAX_IMAGE_SIDE` 4096, `MAX_ASPECT_RATIO` 4.0, `DEPTH_KIND` metric,
     `DEPTH_UNIT` metres, `DEPTH_RANGES_M`, `FLIP_AUGMENTATION` False, `DELTA_THRESHOLD` 1.25) surfaced;
   - pinned `Intel/zoedepth-nyu-kitti` acquisition at the immutable revision through the carried
     module: the inline `MANIFEST` is asserted against the module identity and written to
     `weights/zoedepth-nyu-kitti/`, `stage_missing_files(WEIGHTS_DIR, allow_download=True)` reports all
     4 manifest entries on a clean runtime, `verify_snapshot` returns its summary dict, and
     `from_pretrained(weights_dir=WEIGHTS_DIR)` loads from the verified directory with no further Hub
     access (any download in the logs after staging is a finding);
   - `validate_inputs` writes `outputs/zoedepth_metric_depth_input_manifest.json` (verdict `accepted`,
     one input with its aspect ratio, one recorded rejection finding from the panorama probe);
   - `predict` returning a float32 640×480 map in metres; record the minimum/median/maximum and the probe
     depths (the card-pass CPU smoke gave 1.59 / 1.82 / 1.90 m with the near box at 1.69 m and the far
     cabinet at 1.87 m; a materially different result is a finding to record, not a failure by itself,
     because no metric is asserted — kernels differ across devices);
   - `evaluation_report` writes `outputs/zoedepth_metric_depth_evaluation_report.json` with verdict
     `not-measurable` (no reference depth on the default path, by design; `sample-sanity` with `abs_rel`
     and `delta1` only when the learner uploads a metric reference), the probe observations attached,
     stated as such;
   - `outputs/zoedepth_metric_depth_result.json`, `outputs/zoedepth_metric_depth_depth.npy` and
     `outputs/zoedepth_metric_depth_preview.png` written with `NOTEBOOK_SOURCE`, model revision, model
     licence, runtime versions and device;
6. verify the exports exist and the interpretation section matches the observed path;
7. record the notebook Git blob id, commit, runtime (platform, Python, PyTorch, Transformers, device),
   model identifier and immutable revision, whether the model cache was clean, outcome, produced
   outputs, and any warning or applicable `SHOULD` deviation in the table below;
8. record no access tokens or other secrets.

A known-failing default path in the supported runtime blocks release.

## Recorded executions

Notebook identity is the Git blob id of `tutorials/zoedepth_metric_depth_colab.ipynb` (verify with
`git rev-parse <commit>:tutorials/zoedepth_metric_depth_colab.ipynb`). Wall times, when recorded,
are the sum of per-cell times reported by the executor and include installs and the model download;
they are measurements for the stated runtime, not general estimates.

### Local pre-flight evidence (not a supported runtime)

| Date (UTC) | Commit / notebook blob | Executor | Path exercised | Wall | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
__LOCAL_ROW__

### Manual clean-runtime evidence

| Date (UTC) | Commit / notebook blob | Executor | Path exercised | Wall | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | Default sample path | | pending — no Colab/Kaggle run yet |

## Current status

No clean-runtime execution in a **supported** runtime (Colab or Kaggle) has been recorded yet; the run is
**pending**. What exists: static validation (`tools/validate_release_assets.py`), the generator parity
checks (`--check` OK), the offline unit suite, and one **local fresh-kernel execution** of the generated
notebook (table above) that exercised the standalone carrier, the real `hf_hub_download` staging path
into an empty `weights/` directory, verification, depth estimation, the evaluation report and every export —
which is necessary but not promotion evidence because the workstation is not a supported runtime. The
registry status remains **Candidate** until a reviewer confirms a recorded supported-runtime run against
the notebook blob under review and an integrator promotes it. Facts a reviewer should weigh: the CUDA
path has not been executed; the output is metres with no confidence and no abstention — a blank white
image received 1.43–2.33 m and uniform noise 1.39–1.82 m in the smoke run, so plausible metres are not
evidence of correctness; the tutorial sample is a flat cartoon whose true metres do not exist, so its
report is `not-measurable` by design and the near/far probe ordering is an observation only; the
internal indoor/outdoor head choice is not exposed; flip augmentation doubles the cost for a 0.024 m mean
change on the room; and the pinned snapshot's `ZoeDepthImageProcessor` post-processing is the resize path
the smoke numbers were measured with.
